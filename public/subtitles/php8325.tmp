- Tell me where my notes are.

533
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,625
- Bottom shelf. Basket.

534
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,875
- Ah, here's my little
jet-setter.

535
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,041
- Hi, Mom.

536
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,875
- Ooh, are you sure
you're getting enough rest?

537
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:35,834
You know, we all need
eight hours of sleep,

538
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:37,125
including those
who just journey

539
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,625
across all those
different time zones.

540
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:39,917
- Yes, Mother.

541
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,208
- Maybe you should think
about settling down.

542
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,166
That would be nice--
- Mother--

543
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,250
- I'm just--I'm glad

544
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,458
to have you home
for the holidays, you know,

545
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,667
especially after Mama Belle's
unexpected injury.

546
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,583
- I know.
- I am fine.

00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,375
- Oh, you look fine.

548
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,417
- Baby.
- You look good.

549
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,709
- Yeah, it's just
a little thing.

550
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:57,250

Well, why don't we

I have a lot to tell you about.

553
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,291
I just came back
from New Orleans

554
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,000
with my very special friend.

555
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,917
- Um, actually,

556
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,709
I am about to go run
to a meeting for Jamboree.

557
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:12,625
- The Christmas Jamboree?

558
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,625
- Yes, Jazmin was kind enough

559
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:17,792
to step in while
I'm mildly incapacitated.

560
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,417
- Oh, so--so that means

561
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,125
you're gonna be around
for a little while.

562
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:24,667
- Yep, a whole week.
Plenty of time to catch up.

563
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,083
- Uh, did you call your dad?
- No, not recently.

564
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,166
Why? Isn't he out of town?

565
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,792
- He's back.

566
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,041
- All right,
when I get a minute.

567
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,417
Love you guys.

568
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,250
- Love you too, honey.
- Bye.

569
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,333

- Okay, so let's go over
the schedule of events

586
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,083
for the remaining six days.

587
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:25,208
First, we have
the basketball Snow Jam,

588
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,542
then the bake-off,

589
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,583
then we have the art exhibit,

590
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:31,208
um, poetry slam, fashion bash,

591
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,875
and lastly,
the Christmas Eve dinner.

592
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:35,750
- Baby, we all know
the schedule.

593
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,333
- Right, we know the schedule.
- It's the same every year.

594
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:40,166
- But I'm here
to streamline the workload.

595
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,250
To implement changes as needed.

596
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,083
To improve and strengthen
for maximum effectiveness.

597
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,667
- Implement and strengthen it?
What's that supposed to mean?

598
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,125
- What's this?

599
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:52,125
- This is an org chart.
- What's that for?

600
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,834
- Well, if you just look at
the chart and find your name,

601
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:54,834
you'll see where you're needed.

602
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:56,083
- But I--I don't know

603
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,542
the first thing
about poetry slams.

604
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,750
- But you're in charge
of the fashion bash.

605
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,208
- I am.

606
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,417
- Which means you have
an eye for aesthetics.

607
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,834
- I do.

608
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:04,250
- So why not bring
that je ne sais quoi

609
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,417

00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,875
- Ooh.
- I will not.

Alvin, you are an athlete.

So Caleb and I
can use your help

and Miss Arlene,

616
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:21,083
you are the life of the party,
so why not consider

617
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:23,583
using your efforts
in--in more than one event?

618
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:27,417
- The holiday bake-off
is my thing every year.

619
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,000
I know my way
around the kitchen.

620
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,875
- Yes, she does.
She--she does.

621
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,542
- Okay, then, so--so instead

622
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,291
of just cooking
at the bake-off,

623
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,166
why not provide snacks
and charcuterie

624
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,750
to all of the events?

Everybody loves a passed plate.

- Um, Jazmin, as co-chairs,

627
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:45,250
maybe you and I can have
a meeting in the boardroom.

628
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:48,208
Come on.

629
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:49,625
What are you doing?
- I'm team-building.

630
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:50,792
- The team's built,
and they have

631
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,083
a pretty clear idea
of what they want.

632
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,583
- Okay, but if they just look
at my chart,

633
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,125
they see that my way
is more efficient.

634
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:57,291
- They've been doing Jamboree
for years, Jazmin,

635
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,959
and besides,
this group can get riled

636
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,500
about too much change
too quickly.

637
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:02,667
- Okay, then what
is my purpose here?

638
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,083
- Be supportive, help with
emergencies that come up,

639
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,500
and lend an extra hand
at each event.

640
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:08,959
I don't know.

641
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:11,166
Don't try to fix something
that isn't broken.

642
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,041
Hey, just trust me on this.

643
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:16,625
- Meeting adjourned.

644
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:24,750
- Okay, so I might have
overthought a few things.

645
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:27,041
So how about
we just table that chart

646
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,542
and you guys just keep doing
what you know how to do?

647
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,583
all: Mm-hmm.

648
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:36,375
- Hey, Mama Belle.

649
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:39,959
- Oh, Jaz.

650
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:42,667
Hey, would you like
to help me with these?

651
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,291

Okay.

- All right. Uh-uh.

655
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,000
- Yes.

656
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:55,458
- So how was Jamboree?

657
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:58,709
- Okay...for the most part.

658
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:05,250
Working with Caleb is fine.

659
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:08,166

that I don't remember.

Do me a favor.

Go over, look under the tree,
and grab the gold bag.

- How do you mean?

670
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:33,917
- Like, you would give everyone

671
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
the person you think
they should have

672
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,834
so that you would think
about them

673
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:42,834
and appreciate them more
right when it mattered most.

674
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:44,875
Like when I picked mom
and her and I were fighting

I should go to.
